# BlockPrinting
CP3 Block printing materials along with project for the semester. My block print was inspired by herringbone flooring patters. 
I wanted to draw a lot of inspiration for symetry and clean crisp lines. The original intention was to replicate the herringbone structure, but I had discovered a more interesting pattern that could be tessilated.

# CP3 Semster Project

I am super interested in exploring android app development in processing. I have done some preliminary research on apps and things that can be done in processing and have a goal of first creating a small pong app, and then looking into interactive wallpapers. I think these are so interesting and could offer a lot to what I want to do in my Senior Capstone. I think it’s very interesting and offers a lot to what I want to do in developing an app. I think understanding a simple interface will be very helpful and offer a lot of insight to possibly something I could be interested in. 

After further research I found that the interactive backgrounds could be something explored further. I think it would be cool to explore this idea and have multiple screens all interacting together. I could see a lot of little screens all connected and moving together as one but still separate. Below is a video of screens interacting which is something I hope to attain. The play between the two screens is something that could definitely be played more with.

A long term goal though would be working on something that also could be used with google VR. I really want to develop something that is 3D which I think could be a very interesting challenge. I never tried to code in the third dimension but I think it would be an interesting task. But this would be something that’s more of a long long term goal.

I made a pinterest inspiration board that is made of landscapes that offer a wide variety of being animated. I would want to focus on subtle animations that would make the scene stand out, because the tiny animations are what makes the difference.
